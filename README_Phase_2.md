## Ensemble Learning Models - Phase II Overview

Ensemble Learning Models combines open source Python tools to support large scale learning on satellite imagery and other Earth science data. The current phase of NASA funding for `elm` aims to:
 * Provide a wide variety of ensemble learning options, such as ensemble averaging, hierarchical modeling, and cross validation
 * Provide a variety of spatial preprocessors
 * Create a web-based user interface for common machine learning tasks with satellite imagery, such as labeling features
 * Develop several spectral clustering algorithms for large data
 * Promote `elm` for NASA projects and the satellite / climate science industry

## Milestones

The following milestones describe Phase II work over an 18 to 24 month period.
