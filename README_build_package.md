## How to Build the `elm` Package

* Clone / checkout / pull the code you want to use from the repository
* `conda build conda.recipe --python 3.5`
* You may then have to cut and paste the upload package command from the output or the package will be uploaded automatically, depending on 
your conda-build settings
